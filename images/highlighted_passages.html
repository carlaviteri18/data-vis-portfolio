        <h3>Passage 1</h3>
        <div id="passage-1" class="passage">
          I There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been
          wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning;
          but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early)
          the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain
          so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the
          question. I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on
          chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw
          twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the
          chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my
          physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed. The said
          Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the
          drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her
          darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying)
          looked perfectly happy. Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;
          saying, “She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a
          distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by
          her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to
          acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive
          and sprightly manner—something lighter, franker, more natural, as it
          were—she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for
          contented, happy, little children.” “What does Bessie say I have
          done?” I asked. “Jane, I don’t like cavillers or questioners; besides,
          there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in
          that manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly,
          remain silent.” A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped
          in there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a
          volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I
          mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat
          cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain
          nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement. Folds of scarlet
          drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear
          panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear
          November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book,
          I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale
          blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat
          shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and
          lamentable blast. I returned to my book—Bewick’s History of British
          Birds: the letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking;
          and yet there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I
          could not pass quite as a blank. They were those which treat of the
          haunts of sea-fowl; of “the solitary rocks and promontories” by them
          only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its
          southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape— “Where
          the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls, Boils round the naked, melancholy
          isles Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge Pours in among the
          stormy Hebrides.” Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the
          bleak shores of Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland,
          Greenland, with “the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn
          regions of dreary space,—that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm
          fields of ice, the accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in
          Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the
          multiplied rigours of extreme cold.” Of these death-white realms I
          formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended
          notions that float dim through children’s brains, but strangely
          impressive. The words in these introductory pages connected themselves
          with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance to the rock
          standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken boat
          stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing
          through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking. I cannot tell what
          sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with its inscribed
          headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon, girdled by a
          broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the hour of
          eventide. The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be
          marine phantoms. The fiend pinning down the thief’s pack behind him, I
          passed over quickly: it was an object of terror. So was the black
          horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant crowd
          surrounding a gallows. Each picture told a story; mysterious often to
          my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever
          profoundly interesting: as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes
          narrated on winter evenings, when she chanced to be in good humour;
          and when, having brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she
          allowed us to sit about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed’s lace
          frills, and crimped her nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with
          passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other
          ballads; or (as at a later period I discovered) from the pages of
          Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland. With Bewick on my knee, I was
          then happy: happy at least in my way. I feared nothing but
          interruption, and that came too soon. The breakfast-room door opened.
          “Boh! Madam Mope!” cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he
          found the room apparently empty. “Where the dickens is she!” he
          continued. “Lizzy! Georgy! (calling to his sisters) Joan is not here:
          tell mama she is run out into the rain—bad animal!” “It is well I drew
          the curtain,” thought I; and I wished fervently he might not discover
          my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out himself; he was
          not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just put her head
          in at the door, and said at once— “She is in the window-seat, to be
          sure, Jack.” And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of
          being dragged forth by the said Jack. “What do you want?” I asked,
          with awkward diffidence. “Say, ‘What do you want, Master Reed?’” was
          the answer. “I want you to come here;” and seating himself in an
          arm-chair, he intimated by a gesture that I was to approach and stand
          before him. John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four
          years older than I, for I was but ten: large and stout for his age,
          with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious
          visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself
          habitually at table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and
          bleared eye and flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school;
          but his mama had taken him home for a month or two, “on account of his
          delicate health.” Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he would do
          very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home; but
          the mother’s heart turned from an opinion so harsh, and inclined
          rather to the more refined idea that John’s sallowness was owing to
          over-application and, perhaps, to pining after home. John had not much
          affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy to me. He
          bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week, nor once
          or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared him,
          and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near. There
          were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired, because
          I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his
          inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by
          taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the
          subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did
          both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however,
          behind her back. Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair:
          he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far
          as he could without damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike,
          and while dreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly
          appearance of him who would presently deal it. I wonder if he read
          that notion in my face; for, all at once, without speaking, he struck
          suddenly and strongly. I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium
          retired back a step or two from his chair. “That is for your impudence
          in answering mama awhile since,” said he, “and for your sneaking way
          of getting behind curtains, and for the look you had in your eyes two
          minutes since, you rat!” Accustomed to John Reed’s abuse, I never had
          an idea of replying to it; my care was how to endure the blow which
          would certainly follow the insult. “What were you doing behind the
          curtain?” he asked. “I was reading.” “Show the book.” I returned to
          the window and fetched it thence. “You have no business to take our
          books; you are a dependent, mama says; you have no money; your father
          left you none; you ought to beg, and not to live here with gentlemen’s
          children like us, and eat the same meals we do, and wear clothes at
          our mama’s expense. Now, I’ll teach you to rummage my bookshelves: for
          they _are_ mine; all the house belongs to me, or will do in a few
          years. Go and stand by the door, out of the way of the mirror and the
          windows.” I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but
          when I saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I
          instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough,
          however; the volume was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head
          against the door and cutting it. The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my
          terror had passed its climax; other feelings succeeded. “Wicked and
          cruel boy!” I said. “You are like a murderer—you are like a
          slave-driver—you are like the Roman emperors!” I had read Goldsmith’s
          History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of Nero, Caligula, &c. Also
          I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never thought thus to have
          declared aloud. “What! what!” he cried. “Did she say that to me? Did
          you hear her, Eliza and Georgiana? Won’t I tell mama? but first—” He
          ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had
          closed with a desperate thing. I really saw in him a tyrant, a
          murderer. I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my
          neck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations
          for the time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic
          sort. I don’t very well know what I did with my hands, but he called
          me “Rat! Rat!” and bellowed out aloud. Aid was near him: Eliza and
          Georgiana had run for Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came
          upon the scene, followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot. We were parted:
          I heard the words— “Dear! dear! What a fury to fly at Master John!”
          “Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!” Then Mrs. Reed
          subjoined— “Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there.”
          Four hands were immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.

        <h3>Passage 2</h3>
        <div id="passage-2" class="passage">
          XIX The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the
          Sibyl—if Sibyl she were—was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at
          the chimney-corner. She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or
          rather, a broad-brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped
          handkerchief under her chin. An extinguished candle stood on the
          table; she was bending over the fire, and seemed reading in a little
          black book, like a prayer-book, by the light of the blaze: she
          muttered the words to herself, as most old women do, while she read;
          she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it appeared she wished
          to finish a paragraph. I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which
          were rather cold with sitting at a distance from the drawing-room
          fire. I felt now as composed as ever I did in my life: there was
          nothing indeed in the gipsy’s appearance to trouble one’s calm. She
          shut her book and slowly looked up; her hat-brim partially shaded her
          face, yet I could see, as she raised it, that it was a strange one. It
          looked all brown and black: elf-locks bristled out from beneath a
          white band which passed under her chin, and came half over her cheeks,
          or rather jaws: her eye confronted me at once, with a bold and direct
          gaze. “Well, and you want your fortune told?” she said, in a voice as
          decided as her glance, as harsh as her features. “I don’t care about
          it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to warn you, I have
          no faith.” “It’s like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you;
          I heard it in your step as you crossed the threshold.” “Did you?
          You’ve a quick ear.” “I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain.” “You
          need them all in your trade.” “I do; especially when I’ve customers
          like you to deal with. Why don’t you tremble?” “I’m not cold.” “Why
          don’t you turn pale?” “I am not sick.” “Why don’t you consult my art?”
          “I’m not silly.” The old crone “nichered” a laugh under her bonnet and
          bandage; she then drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began
          to smoke. Having indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her
          bent body, took the pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at
          the fire, said very deliberately— “You are cold; you are sick; and you
          are silly.” “Prove it,” I rejoined. “I will, in few words. You are
          cold, because you are alone: no contact strikes the fire from you that
          is in you. You are sick; because the best of feelings, the highest and
          the sweetest given to man, keeps far away from you. You are silly,
          because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon it to approach, nor
          will you stir one step to meet it where it waits you.” She again put
          her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking with vigour.
          “You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a
          solitary dependent in a great house.” “I might say it to almost any
          one: but would it be true of almost any one?” “In my circumstances.”
          “Yes; just so, in _your_ circumstances: but find me another precisely
          placed as you are.” “It would be easy to find you thousands.” “You
          could scarcely find me one. If you knew it, you are peculiarly
          situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it. The materials
          are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them. Chance
          laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and bliss
          results.” “I don’t understand enigmas. I never could guess a riddle in
          my life.” “If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm.”
          “And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?” “To be sure.” I gave her
          a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she took out of
          her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she told me to
          hold out my hand. I did. She approached her face to the palm, and
          pored over it without touching it. “It is too fine,” said she. “I can
          make nothing of such a hand as that; almost without lines: besides,
          what is in a palm? Destiny is not written there.” “I believe you,”
          said I. “No,” she continued, “it is in the face: on the forehead,
          about the eyes, in the lines of the mouth. Kneel, and lift up your
          head.” “Ah! now you are coming to reality,” I said, as I obeyed her.
          “I shall begin to put some faith in you presently.” I knelt within
          half a yard of her. She stirred the fire, so that a ripple of light
          broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as she sat, only
          threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined. “I wonder with
          what feelings you came to me to-night,” she said, when she had
          examined me a while. “I wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart
          during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people
          flitting before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little
          sympathetic communion passing between you and them as if they were
          really mere shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance.” “I
          feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad.” “Then you have
          some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with whispers of the
          future?” “Not I. The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my
          earnings to set up a school some day in a little house rented by
          myself.” “A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in
          that window-seat (you see I know your habits)—” “You have learned them
          from the servants.” “Ah! you think yourself sharp. Well, perhaps I
          have: to speak truth, I have an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs.
          Poole—” I started to my feet when I heard the name. “You have—have
          you?” thought I; “there is diablerie in the business after all, then!”
          “Don’t be alarmed,” continued the strange being; “she’s a safe hand is
          Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her.
          But, as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of
          nothing but your future school? Have you no present interest in any of
          the company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you? Is there not
          one face you study? one figure whose movements you follow with at
          least curiosity?” “I like to observe all the faces and all the
          figures.” “But do you never single one from the rest—or it may be,
          two?” “I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem
          telling a tale: it amuses me to watch them.” “What tale do you like
          best to hear?” “Oh, I have not much choice! They generally run on the
          same theme—courtship; and promise to end in the same
          catastrophe—marriage.” “And do you like that monotonous theme?”
          “Positively, I don’t care about it: it is nothing to me.” “Nothing to
          you? When a lady, young and full of life and health, charming with
          beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune, sits and smiles
          in the eyes of a gentleman you—” “I what?” “You know—and perhaps think
          well of.” “I don’t know the gentlemen here. I have scarcely
          interchanged a syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of
          them, I consider some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and
          others young, dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are
          all at liberty to be the recipients of whose smiles they please,
          without my feeling disposed to consider the transaction of any moment
          to me.” “You don’t know the gentlemen here? You have not exchanged a
          syllable with one of them? Will you say that of the master of the
          house!” “He is not at home.” “A profound remark! A most ingenious
          quibble! He went to Millcote this morning, and will be back here
          to-night or to-morrow: does that circumstance exclude him from the
          list of your acquaintance—blot him, as it were, out of existence?”
          “No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the
          theme you had introduced.” “I was talking of ladies smiling in the
          eyes of gentlemen; and of late so many smiles have been shed into Mr.
          Rochester’s eyes that they overflow like two cups filled above the
          brim: have you never remarked that?” “Mr. Rochester has a right to
          enjoy the society of his guests.” “No question about his right: but
          have you never observed that, of all the tales told here about
          matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured with the most lively and
          the most continuous?” “The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue
          of a narrator.” I said this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose
          strange talk, voice, manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of
          dream. One unexpected sentence came from her lips after another, till
          I got involved in a web of mystification; and wondered what unseen
          spirit had been sitting for weeks by my heart watching its workings
          and taking record of every pulse. “Eagerness of a listener!” repeated
          she: “yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by the hour, his ear inclined to the
          fascinating lips that took such delight in their task of
          communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to receive and looked
          so grateful for the pastime given him; you have noticed this?”
          “Grateful! I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face.”
          “Detecting! You have analysed, then. And what did you detect, if not
          gratitude?” I said nothing. “You have seen love: have you not?—and,
          looking forward, you have seen him married, and beheld his bride
          happy?” “Humph! Not exactly. Your witch’s skill is rather at fault
          sometimes.” “What the devil have you seen, then?” “Never mind: I came
          here to inquire, not to confess. Is it known that Mr. Rochester is to
          be married?” “Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram.” “Shortly?”
          “Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though,
          with an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to
          question it), they will be a superlatively happy pair. He must love
          such a handsome, noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she
          loves him, or, if not his person, at least his purse. I know she
          considers the Rochester estate eligible to the last degree; though
          (God pardon me!) I told her something on that point about an hour ago
          which made her look wondrous grave: the corners of her mouth fell half
          an inch. I would advise her blackaviced suitor to look out: if another
          comes, with a longer or clearer rent-roll,—he’s dished—” “But, mother,
          I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester’s fortune: I came to hear my own;
          and you have told me nothing of it.” “Your fortune is yet doubtful:
          when I examined your face, one trait contradicted another. Chance has
          meted you a measure of happiness: that I know. I knew it before I came
          here this evening. She has laid it carefully on one side for you. I
          saw her do it. It depends on yourself to stretch out your hand, and
          take it up: but whether you will do so, is the problem I study. Kneel
          again on the rug.” “Don’t keep me long; the fire scorches me.” She did
          not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her chair I
          knelt. She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in
          her chair. She began muttering,— “The flame flickers in the eye; the
          eye shines like dew; it looks soft and full of feeling; it smiles at
          my jargon: it is susceptible; impression follows impression through
          its clear sphere; where it ceases to smile, it is sad; an unconscious
          lassitude weighs on the lid: that signifies melancholy resulting from
          loneliness. It turns from me; it will not suffer further scrutiny; it
          seems to deny, by a mocking glance, the truth of the discoveries I
          have already made,—to disown the charge both of sensibility and
          chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me in my opinion. The eye
          is favourable. “As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it
          is disposed to impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay
          it would be silent on much the heart experiences. Mobile and flexible,
          it was never intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of
          solitude: it is a mouth which should speak much and smile often, and
          have human affection for its interlocutor. That feature too is
          propitious. “I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and
          that brow professes to say,—‘I can live alone, if self-respect, and
          circumstances require me so to do. I need not sell my soul to buy
          bliss. I have an inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive
          if all extraneous delights should be withheld, or offered only at a
          price I cannot afford to give.’ The forehead declares, ‘Reason sits
          firm and holds the reins, and she will not let the feelings burst away
          and hurry her to wild chasms. The passions may rage furiously, like
          true heathens, as they are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of
          vain things: but judgment shall still have the last word in every
          argument, and the casting vote in every decision. Strong wind,
          earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by: but I shall follow the guiding
          of that still small voice which interprets the dictates of
          conscience.’ “Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be
          respected. I have formed my plans—right plans I deem them—and in them
          I have attended to the claims of conscience, the counsels of reason. I
          know how soon youth would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of
          bliss offered, but one dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were
          detected; and I do not want sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution—such is not
          my taste. I wish to foster, not to blight—to earn gratitude, not to
          wring tears of blood—no, nor of brine: my harvest must be in smiles,
          in endearments, in sweet—That will do. I think I rave in a kind of
          exquisite delirium. I should wish now to protract this moment _ad
          infinitum_; but I dare not. So far I have governed myself thoroughly.
          I have acted as I inwardly swore I would act; but further might try me
          beyond my strength. Rise, Miss Eyre: leave me; the play is played
          out’.” Where was I? Did I wake or sleep? Had I been dreaming? Did I
          dream still? The old woman’s voice had changed: her accent, her
          gesture, and all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass—as the
          speech of my own tongue. I got up, but did not go. I looked; I stirred
          the fire, and I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage
          closer about her face, and again beckoned me to depart. The flame
          illuminated her hand stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for
          discoveries, I at once noticed that hand. It was no more the withered
          limb of eld than my own; it was a rounded supple member, with smooth
          fingers, symmetrically turned; a broad ring flashed on the little
          finger, and stooping forward, I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen
          a hundred times before. Again I looked at the face; which was no
          longer turned from me—on the contrary, the bonnet was doffed, the
          bandage displaced, the head advanced. “Well, Jane, do you know me?”
          asked the familiar voice. “Only take off the red cloak, sir, and
          then—” “But the string is in a knot—help me.” “Break it, sir.” “There,
          then—‘Off, ye lendings!’” And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his
          disguise. “Now, sir, what a strange idea!” “But well carried out, eh?
          Don’t you think so?” “With the ladies you must have managed well.”
          “But not with you?” “You did not act the character of a gipsy with
          me.” “What character did I act? My own?” “No; some unaccountable one.
          In short, I believe you have been trying to draw me out—or in; you
          have been talking nonsense to make me talk nonsense. It is scarcely
          fair, sir.” “Do you forgive me, Jane?” “I cannot tell till I have
          thought it all over. If, on reflection, I find I have fallen into no
          great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you; but it was not right.”
          “Oh, you have been very correct—very careful, very sensible.” I
          reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had. It was a comfort; but,
          indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the
          interview. Something of masquerade I suspected. I knew gipsies and
          fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman
          had expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her
          anxiety to conceal her features. But my mind had been running on Grace
          Poole—that living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered
          her. I had never thought of Mr. Rochester. “Well,” said he, “what are
          you musing about? What does that grave smile signify?” “Wonder and
          self-congratulation, sir. I have your permission to retire now, I
          suppose?” “No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the
          drawing-room yonder are doing.” “Discussing the gipsy, I daresay.”
          “Sit down!—Let me hear what they said about me.” “I had better not
          stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o’clock. Oh, are you aware, Mr.
          Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you left this
          morning?” “A stranger!—no; who can it be? I expected no one; is he
          gone?” “No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the
          liberty of installing himself here till you returned.” “The devil he
          did! Did he give his name?” “His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from
          the West Indies; from Spanish Town, in Jamaica, I think.” Mr.
          Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead me
          to a chair. As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile
          on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath. “Mason!—the
          West Indies!” he said, in the tone one might fancy a speaking
          automaton to enounce its single words; “Mason!—the West Indies!” he
          reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times, growing, in
          the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly seemed to know
          what he was doing. “Do you feel ill, sir?” I inquired. “Jane, I’ve got
          a blow; I’ve got a blow, Jane!” He staggered. “Oh, lean on me, sir.”
          “Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now.”
          “Yes, sir, yes; and my arm.” He sat down, and made me sit beside him.
          Holding my hand in both his own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the
          same time, with the most troubled and dreary look. “My little friend!”
          said he, “I wish I were in a quiet island with only you; and trouble,
          and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me.” “Can I help
          you, sir?—I’d give my life to serve you.” “Jane, if aid is wanted,
          I’ll seek it at your hands; I promise you that.” “Thank you, sir. Tell
          me what to do,—I’ll try, at least, to do it.” “Fetch me now, Jane, a
          glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be at supper there; and
          tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is doing.” I went. I found
          all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr. Rochester had said;
          they were not seated at table,—the supper was arranged on the
          sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood about here and
          there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands. Every one
          seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and
          animated. Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and Mrs.
          Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them. I filled a wine-glass (I
          saw Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she thought I was
          taking a liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library. Mr.
          Rochester’s extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more
          firm and stern. He took the glass from my hand. “Here is to your
          health, ministrant spirit!” he said. He swallowed the contents and
          returned it to me. “What are they doing, Jane?” “Laughing and talking,
          sir.” “They don’t look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard
          something strange?” “Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety.”
          “And Mason?” “He was laughing too.” “If all these people came in a
          body and spat at me, what would you do, Jane?” “Turn them out of the
          room, sir, if I could.” He half smiled. “But if I were to go to them,
          and they only looked at me coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst
          each other, and then dropped off and left me one by one, what then?
          Would you go with them?” “I rather think not, sir: I should have more
          pleasure in staying with you.” “To comfort me?” “Yes, sir, to comfort
          you, as well as I could.” “And if they laid you under a ban for
          adhering to me?” “I, probably, should know nothing about their ban;
          and if I did, I should care nothing about it.” “Then, you could dare
          censure for my sake?” “I could dare it for the sake of any friend who
          deserved my adherence; as you, I am sure, do.” “Go back now into the
          room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his ear that Mr.
          Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here and then
          leave me.” “Yes, sir.” I did his behest. The company all stared at me
          as I passed straight among them. I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the
          message, and preceded him from the room: I ushered him into the
          library, and then I went upstairs. At a late hour, after I had been in
          bed some time, I heard the visitors repair to their chambers: I
          distinguished Mr. Rochester’s voice, and heard him say, “This way,
          Mason; this is your room.” He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my
          heart at ease. I was soon asleep.

        <h3>Passage 3</h3>
        <div id="passage-3" class="passage">
          XXXVII The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable
          antiquity, moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep
          buried in a wood. I had heard of it before. Mr. Rochester often spoke
          of it, and sometimes went there. His father had purchased the estate
          for the sake of the game covers. He would have let the house, but
          could find no tenant, in consequence of its ineligible and
          insalubrious site. Ferndean then remained uninhabited and unfurnished,
          with the exception of some two or three rooms fitted up for the
          accommodation of the squire when he went there in the season to shoot.
          To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the
          characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating
          rain. The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise
          and driver with the double remuneration I had promised. Even when
          within a very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing
          of it, so thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.
          Iron gates between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and
          passing through them, I found myself at once in the twilight of
          close-ranked trees. There was a grass-grown track descending the
          forest aisle between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches.
          I followed it, expecting soon to reach the dwelling; but it stretched
          on and on, it wound far and farther: no sign of habitation or grounds
          was visible. I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.
          The darkness of natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me. I
          looked round in search of another road. There was none: all was
          interwoven stem, columnar trunk, dense summer foliage—no opening
          anywhere. I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a
          little; presently I beheld a railing, then the house—scarce, by this
          dim light, distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its
          decaying walls. Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood
          amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a
          semicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad
          gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of
          the forest. The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the
          windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one
          step led up to it. The whole looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms
          had said, “quite a desolate spot.” It was as still as a church on a
          week-day: the pattering rain on the forest leaves was the only sound
          audible in its vicinage. “Can there be life here?” I asked. Yes, life
          of some kind there was; for I heard a movement—that narrow front-door
          was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the grange. It
          opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the
          step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel
          whether it rained. Dusk as it was, I had recognised him—it was my
          master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other. I stayed my step,
          almost my breath, and stood to watch him—to examine him, myself
          unseen, and alas! to him invisible. It was a sudden meeting, and one
          in which rapture was kept well in check by pain. I had no difficulty
          in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty advance.
          His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port
          was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features
          altered or sunk: not in one year’s space, by any sorrow, could his
          athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted. But in
          his countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and
          brooding—that reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or
          bird, dangerous to approach in his sullen woe. The caged eagle, whose
          gold-ringed eyes cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that
          sightless Samson. And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind
          ferocity?—if you do, you little know me. A soft hope blent with my
          sorrow that soon I should dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock,
          and on those lips so sternly sealed beneath it: but not yet. I would
          not accost him yet. He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and
          gropingly towards the grass-plat. Where was his daring stride now?
          Then he paused, as if he knew not which way to turn. He lifted his
          hand and opened his eyelids; gazed blank, and with a straining effort,
          on the sky, and toward the amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to
          him was void darkness. He stretched his right hand (the left arm, the
          mutilated one, he kept hidden in his bosom); he seemed to wish by
          touch to gain an idea of what lay around him: he met but vacancy
          still; for the trees were some yards off where he stood. He
          relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and stood quiet and mute
          in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head. At this moment
          John approached him from some quarter. “Will you take my arm, sir?” he
          said; “there is a heavy shower coming on: had you not better go in?”
          “Let me alone,” was the answer. John withdrew without having observed
          me. Mr. Rochester now tried to walk about: vainly,—all was too
          uncertain. He groped his way back to the house, and, re-entering it,
          closed the door. I now drew near and knocked: John’s wife opened for
          me. “Mary,” I said, “how are you?” She started as if she had seen a
          ghost: I calmed her. To her hurried “Is it really you, miss, come at
          this late hour to this lonely place?” I answered by taking her hand;
          and then I followed her into the kitchen, where John now sat by a good
          fire. I explained to them, in few words, that I had heard all which
          had happened since I left Thornfield, and that I was come to see Mr.
          Rochester. I asked John to go down to the turn-pike-house, where I had
          dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I had left there: and
          then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I questioned Mary as to
          whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House for the night; and
          finding that arrangements to that effect, though difficult, would not
          be impossible, I informed her I should stay. Just at this moment the
          parlour-bell rang. “When you go in,” said I, “tell your master that a
          person wishes to speak to him, but do not give my name.” “I don’t
          think he will see you,” she answered; “he refuses everybody.” When she
          returned, I inquired what he had said. “You are to send in your name
          and your business,” she replied. She then proceeded to fill a glass
          with water, and place it on a tray, together with candles. “Is that
          what he rang for?” I asked. “Yes: he always has candles brought in at
          dark, though he is blind.” “Give the tray to me; I will carry it in.”
          I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door. The tray
          shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my
          ribs loud and fast. Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind
          me. This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low
          in the grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against
          the high, old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the
          room. His old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and
          coiled up as if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon. Pilot
          pricked up his ears when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and
          a whine, and bounded towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my
          hands. I set it on the table; then patted him, and said softly, “Lie
          down!” Mr. Rochester turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion
          was: but as he _saw_ nothing, he returned and sighed. “Give me the
          water, Mary,” he said. I approached him with the now only half-filled
          glass; Pilot followed me, still excited. “What is the matter?” he
          inquired. “Down, Pilot!” I again said. He checked the water on its way
          to his lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down.
          “This is you, Mary, is it not?” “Mary is in the kitchen,” I answered.
          He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I
          stood, he did not touch me. “Who is this? Who is this?” he demanded,
          trying, as it seemed, to _see_ with those sightless eyes—unavailing
          and distressing attempt! “Answer me—speak again!” he ordered,
          imperiously and aloud. “Will you have a little more water, sir? I
          spilt half of what was in the glass,” I said. “_Who_ is it? _What_ is
          it? Who speaks?” “Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here. I
          came only this evening,” I answered. “Great God!—what delusion has
          come over me? What sweet madness has seized me?” “No delusion—no
          madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion, your health too
          sound for frenzy.” “And where is the speaker? Is it only a voice? Oh!
          I _cannot_ see, but I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain
          burst. Whatever—whoever you are—be perceptible to the touch or I
          cannot live!” He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned
          it in both mine. “Her very fingers!” he cried; “her small, slight
          fingers! If so there must be more of her.” The muscular hand broke
          from my custody; my arm was seized, my shoulder—neck—waist—I was
          entwined and gathered to him. “Is it Jane? _What_ is it? This is her
          shape—this is her size—” “And this her voice,” I added. “She is all
          here: her heart, too. God bless you, sir! I am glad to be so near you
          again.” “Jane Eyre!—Jane Eyre,” was all he said. “My dear master,” I
          answered, “I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out—I am come back to
          you.” “In truth?—in the flesh? My living Jane?” “You touch me,
          sir,—you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a corpse, nor
          vacant like air, am I?” “My living darling! These are certainly her
          limbs, and these her features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my
          misery. It is a dream; such dreams as I have had at night when I have
          clasped her once more to my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as
          thus—and felt that she loved me, and trusted that she would not leave
          me.” “Which I never will, sir, from this day.” “Never will, says the
          vision? But I always woke and found it an empty mockery; and I was
          desolate and abandoned—my life dark, lonely, hopeless—my soul athirst
          and forbidden to drink—my heart famished and never to be fed. Gentle,
          soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will fly, too, as your
          sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before you go—embrace
          me, Jane.” “There, sir—and there!”’ I pressed my lips to his once
          brilliant and now rayless eyes—I swept his hair from his brow, and
          kissed that too. He suddenly seemed to arouse himself: the conviction
          of the reality of all this seized him. “It is you—is it, Jane? You are
          come back to me then?” “I am.” “And you do not lie dead in some ditch
          under some stream? And you are not a pining outcast amongst
          strangers?” “No, sir! I am an independent woman now.” “Independent!
          What do you mean, Jane?” “My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me
          five thousand pounds.” “Ah! this is practical—this is real!” he cried:
          “I should never dream that. Besides, there is that peculiar voice of
          hers, so animating and piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered
          heart; it puts life into it.—What, Janet! Are you an independent
          woman? A rich woman?” “Quite rich, sir. If you won’t let me live with
          you, I can build a house of my own close up to your door, and you may
          come and sit in my parlour when you want company of an evening.” “But
          as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will look
          after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter
          like me?” “I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my
          own mistress.” “And you will stay with me?” “Certainly—unless you
          object. I will be your neighbour, your nurse, your housekeeper. I find
          you lonely: I will be your companion—to read to you, to walk with you,
          to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and hands to you. Cease to
          look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not be left desolate, so
          long as I live.” He replied not: he seemed serious—abstracted; he
          sighed; he half-opened his lips as if to speak: he closed them again.
          I felt a little embarrassed. Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped
          conventionalities; and he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my
          inconsiderateness. I had indeed made my proposal from the idea that he
          wished and would ask me to be his wife: an expectation, not the less
          certain because unexpressed, had buoyed me up, that he would claim me
          at once as his own. But no hint to that effect escaping him and his
          countenance becoming more overcast, I suddenly remembered that I might
          have been all wrong, and was perhaps playing the fool unwittingly; and
          I began gently to withdraw myself from his arms—but he eagerly
          snatched me closer. “No—no—Jane; you must not go. No—I have touched
          you, heard you, felt the comfort of your presence—the sweetness of
          your consolation: I cannot give up these joys. I have little left in
          myself—I must have you. The world may laugh—may call me absurd,
          selfish—but it does not signify. My very soul demands you: it will be
          satisfied, or it will take deadly vengeance on its frame.” “Well, sir,
          I will stay with you: I have said so.” “Yes—but you understand one
          thing by staying with me; and I understand another. You, perhaps,
          could make up your mind to be about my hand and chair—to wait on me as
          a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate heart and a generous
          spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for those you pity), and
          that ought to suffice for me no doubt. I suppose I should now
          entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think so?
          Come—tell me.” “I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be
          only your nurse, if you think it better.” “But you cannot always be my
          nurse, Janet: you are young—you must marry one day.” “I don’t care
          about being married.” “You should care, Janet: if I were what I once
          was, I would try to make you care—but—a sightless block!” He relapsed
          again into gloom. I, on the contrary, became more cheerful, and took
          fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where the
          difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite
          relieved from my previous embarrassment. I resumed a livelier vein of
          conversation. “It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you,” said
          I, parting his thick and long uncut locks; “for I see you are being
          metamorphosed into a lion, or something of that sort. You have a ‘faux
          air’ of Nebuchadnezzar in the fields about you, that is certain: your
          hair reminds me of eagles’ feathers; whether your nails are grown like
          birds’ claws or not, I have not yet noticed.” “On this arm, I have
          neither hand nor nails,” he said, drawing the mutilated limb from his
          breast, and showing it to me. “It is a mere stump—a ghastly sight!
          Don’t you think so, Jane?” “It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see
          your eyes—and the scar of fire on your forehead: and the worst of it
          is, one is in danger of loving you too well for all this; and making
          too much of you.” “I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw
          my arm, and my cicatrised visage.” “Did you? Don’t tell me so—lest I
          should say something disparaging to your judgment. Now, let me leave
          you an instant, to make a better fire, and have the hearth swept up.
          Can you tell when there is a good fire?” “Yes; with the right eye I
          see a glow—a ruddy haze.” “And you see the candles?” “Very dimly—each
          is a luminous cloud.” “Can you see me?” “No, my fairy: but I am only
          too thankful to hear and feel you.” “When do you take supper?” “I
          never take supper.” “But you shall have some to-night. I am hungry: so
          are you, I daresay, only you forget.” Summoning Mary, I soon had the
          room in more cheerful order: I prepared him, likewise, a comfortable
          repast. My spirits were excited, and with pleasure and ease I talked
          to him during supper, and for a long time after. There was no
          harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and vivacity with him; for
          with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I suited him; all I
          said or did seemed either to console or revive him. Delightful
          consciousness! It brought to life and light my whole nature: in his
          presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine. Blind as he was,
          smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his
          lineaments softened and warmed. After supper, he began to ask me many
          questions, of where I had been, what I had been doing, how I had found
          him out; but I gave him only very partial replies: it was too late to
          enter into particulars that night. Besides, I wished to touch no
          deep-thrilling chord—to open no fresh well of emotion in his heart: my
          sole present aim was to cheer him. Cheered, as I have said, he was:
          and yet but by fits. If a moment’s silence broke the conversation, he
          would turn restless, touch me, then say, “Jane.” “You are altogether a
          human being, Jane? You are certain of that?” You are altogether a
          human being, Jane? You are certain of that? “I conscientiously believe
          so, Mr. Rochester.” “Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could
          you so suddenly rise on my lone hearth? I stretched my hand to take a
          glass of water from a hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a
          question, expecting John’s wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at
          my ear.” “Because I had come in, in Mary’s stead, with the tray.” “And
          there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you. Who
          can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for
          months past? Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day;
          feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of
          hunger when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at
          times, a very delirium of desire to behold my Jane again. Yes: for her
          restoration I longed, far more than for that of my lost sight. How can
          it be that Jane is with me, and says she loves me? Will she not depart
          as suddenly as she came? To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more.”
          A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed
          ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this
          frame of mind. I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that
          they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make
          them grow as broad and black as ever. “Where is the use of doing me
          good in any way, beneficent spirit, when, at some fatal moment, you
          will again desert me—passing like a shadow, whither and how to me
          unknown, and for me remaining afterwards undiscoverable?” “Have you a
          pocket-comb about you, sir?” “What for, Jane?” “Just to comb out this
          shaggy black mane. I find you rather alarming, when I examine you
          close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am sure, you are
          more like a brownie.” “Am I hideous, Jane?” “Very, sir: you always
          were, you know.” “Humph! The wickedness has not been taken out of you,
          wherever you have sojourned.” “Yet I have been with good people; far
          better than you: a hundred times better people; possessed of ideas and
          views you never entertained in your life: quite more refined and
          exalted.” “Who the deuce have you been with?” “If you twist in that
          way you will make me pull the hair out of your head; and then I think
          you will cease to entertain doubts of my substantiality.” “Who have
          you been with, Jane?” “You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir;
          you must wait till to-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you
          know, be a sort of security that I shall appear at your breakfast
          table to finish it. By the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth
          with only a glass of water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to
          say nothing of fried ham.” “You mocking changeling—fairy-born and
          human-bred! You make me feel as I have not felt these twelve months.
          If Saul could have had you for his David, the evil spirit would have
          been exorcised without the aid of the harp.” “There, sir, you are redd
          up and made decent. Now I’ll leave you: I have been travelling these
          last three days, and I believe I am tired. Good night.” “Just one
          word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have been?”
          I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs. “A
          good idea!” I thought with glee. “I see I have the means of fretting
          him out of his melancholy for some time to come.” Very early the next
          morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from one room to another.
          As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: “Is Miss Eyre here?”
          Then: “Which room did you put her into? Was it dry? Is she up? Go and
          ask if she wants anything; and when she will come down.” I came down
          as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast. Entering the
          room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered my
          presence. It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that
          vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity. He sat in his chair—still,
          but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual
          sadness marking his strong features. His countenance reminded one of a
          lamp quenched, waiting to be re-lit—and alas! it was not himself that
          could now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was dependent
          on another for that office! I had meant to be gay and careless, but
          the powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick:
          still I accosted him with what vivacity I could. “It is a bright,
          sunny morning, sir,” I said. “The rain is over and gone, and there is
          a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk soon.” I had wakened
          the glow: his features beamed. “Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark!
          Come to me. You are not gone: not vanished? I heard one of your kind
          an hour ago, singing high over the wood: but its song had no music for
          me, any more than the rising sun had rays. All the melody on earth is
          concentrated in my Jane’s tongue to my ear (I am glad it is not
          naturally a silent one): all the sunshine I can feel is in her
          presence.” The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his
          dependence; just as if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be
          forced to entreat a sparrow to become its purveyor. But I would not be
          lachrymose: I dashed off the salt drops, and busied myself with
          preparing breakfast. Most of the morning was spent in the open air. I
          led him out of the wet and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I
          described to him how brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and
          hedges looked refreshed; how sparklingly blue was the sky. I sought a
          seat for him in a hidden and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor
          did I refuse to let him, when seated, place me on his knee. Why should
          I, when both he and I were happier near than apart? Pilot lay beside
          us: all was quiet. He broke out suddenly while clasping me in his
          arms— “Cruel, cruel deserter! Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I
          discovered you had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find
          you; and, after examining your apartment, ascertained that you had
          taken no money, nor anything which could serve as an equivalent! A
          pearl necklace I had given you lay untouched in its little casket;
          your trunks were left corded and locked as they had been prepared for
          the bridal tour. What could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and
          penniless? And what did she do? Let me hear now.” Thus urged, I began
          the narrative of my experience for the last year. I softened
          considerably what related to the three days of wandering and
          starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict
          unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart
          deeper than I wished. I should not have left him thus, he said,
          without any means of making my way: I should have told him my
          intention. I should have confided in him: he would never have forced
          me to be his mistress. Violent as he had seemed in his despair, he, in
          truth, loved me far too well and too tenderly to constitute himself my
          tyrant: he would have given me half his fortune, without demanding so
          much as a kiss in return, rather than I should have flung myself
          friendless on the wide world. I had endured, he was certain, more than
          I had confessed to him. “Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they
          were very short,” I answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I
          had been received at Moor House; how I had obtained the office of
          schoolmistress, &c. The accession of fortune, the discovery of my
          relations, followed in due order. Of course, St. John Rivers’ name
          came in frequently in the progress of my tale. When I had done, that
          name was immediately taken up. “This St. John, then, is your cousin?”
          “Yes.” “You have spoken of him often: do you like him?” “He was a very
          good man, sir; I could not help liking him.” “A good man. Does that
          mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty? Or what does it mean?”
          “St John was only twenty-nine, sir.” “‘_Jeune encore_,’ as the French
          say. Is he a person of low stature, phlegmatic, and plain. A person
          whose goodness consists rather in his guiltlessness of vice, than in
          his prowess in virtue.” “He is untiringly active. Great and exalted
          deeds are what he lives to perform.” “But his brain? That is probably
          rather soft? He means well: but you shrug your shoulders to hear him
          talk?” “He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point.
          His brain is first-rate, I should think not impressible, but
          vigorous.” “Is he an able man, then?” “Truly able.” “A thoroughly
          educated man?” “St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar.”
          “His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?—priggish and
          parsonic?” “I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very
          bad taste, they must suit it; they are polished, calm, and
          gentlemanlike.” “His appearance,—I forget what description you gave of
          his appearance;—a sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white
          neckcloth, and stilted up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?” “St. John
          dresses well. He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue eyes, and a
          Grecian profile.” (Aside.) “Damn him!”—(To me.) “Did you like him,
          Jane?” “Yes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that
          before.” I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor.
          Jealousy had got hold of him: she stung him; but the sting was
          salutary: it gave him respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy. I
          would not, therefore, immediately charm the snake. “Perhaps you would
          rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?” was the next
          somewhat unexpected observation. “Why not, Mr. Rochester?” “The
          picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too overwhelming
          contrast. Your words have delineated very prettily a graceful Apollo:
          he is present to your imagination,—tall, fair, blue-eyed, and with a
          Grecian profile. Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,—a real blacksmith,
          brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the bargain.” “I
          never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like Vulcan,
          sir.” “Well, you can leave me, ma’am: but before you go” (and he
          retained me by a firmer grasp than ever), “you will be pleased just to
          answer me a question or two.” He paused. “What questions, Mr.
          Rochester?” Then followed this cross-examination. “St. John made you
          schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his cousin?” “Yes.”
          “You would often see him? He would visit the school sometimes?”
          “Daily.” “He would approve of your plans, Jane? I know they would be
          clever, for you are a talented creature!” “He approved of them—yes.”
          “He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to
          find? Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary.” “I don’t know
          about that.” “You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did
          he ever come there to see you?” “Now and then?” “Of an evening?” “Once
          or twice.” A pause. “How long did you reside with him and his sisters
          after the cousinship was discovered?” “Five months.” “Did Rivers spend
          much time with the ladies of his family?” “Yes; the back parlour was
          both his study and ours: he sat near the window, and we by the table.”
          “Did he study much?” “A good deal.” “What?” “Hindostanee.” “And what
          did you do meantime?” “I learnt German, at first.” “Did he teach you?”
          “He did not understand German.” “Did he teach you nothing?” “A little
          Hindostanee.” “Rivers taught you Hindostanee?” “Yes, sir.” “And his
          sisters also?” “No.” “Only you?” “Only me.” “Did you ask to learn?”
          “No.” “He wished to teach you?” “Yes.” A second pause. “Why did he
          wish it? Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?” “He intended me to
          go with him to India.” “Ah! here I reach the root of the matter. He
          wanted you to marry him?” “He asked me to marry him.” “That is a
          fiction—an impudent invention to vex me.” “I beg your pardon, it is
          the literal truth: he asked me more than once, and was as stiff about
          urging his point as ever you could be.” “Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you
          can leave me. How often am I to say the same thing? Why do you remain
          pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I have given you notice to
          quit?” “Because I am comfortable there.” “No, Jane, you are not
          comfortable there, because your heart is not with me: it is with this
          cousin—this St. John. Oh, till this moment, I thought my little Jane
          was all mine! I had a belief she loved me even when she left me: that
          was an atom of sweet in much bitter. Long as we have been parted, hot
          tears as I have wept over our separation, I never thought that while I
          was mourning her, she was loving another! But it is useless grieving.
          Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers.” “Shake me off, then, sir,—push
          me away, for I’ll not leave you of my own accord.” “Jane, I ever like
          your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds so truthful. When
          I hear it, it carries me back a year. I forget that you have formed a
          new tie. But I am not a fool—go—” “Where must I go, sir?” “Your own
          way—with the husband you have chosen.” “Who is that?” “You know—this
          St. John Rivers.” “He is not my husband, nor ever will be. He does not
          love me: I do not love him. He loves (as he _can_ love, and that is
          not as you love) a beautiful young lady called Rosamond. He wanted to
          marry me only because he thought I should make a suitable missionary’s
          wife, which she would not have done. He is good and great, but severe;
          and, for me, cold as an iceberg. He is not like you, sir: I am not
          happy at his side, nor near him, nor with him. He has no indulgence
          for me—no fondness. He sees nothing attractive in me; not even
          youth—only a few useful mental points.—Then I must leave you, sir, to
          go to him?” I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer
          to my blind but beloved master. He smiled. “What, Jane! Is this true?
          Is such really the state of matters between you and Rivers?”
          “Absolutely, sir! Oh, you need not be jealous! I wanted to tease you a
          little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than
          grief. But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I
          _do_ love you, you would be proud and content. All my heart is yours,
          sir: it belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to
          exile the rest of me from your presence for ever.” Again, as he kissed
          me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect. “My seared vision! My
          crippled strength!” he murmured regretfully. I caressed, in order to
          soothe him. I knew of what he was thinking, and wanted to speak for
          him, but dared not. As he turned aside his face a minute, I saw a tear
          slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down the manly cheek.
          My heart swelled. “I am no better than the old lightning-struck
          chestnut-tree in Thornfield orchard,” he remarked ere long. “And what
          right would that ruin have to bid a budding woodbine cover its decay
          with freshness?” “You are no ruin, sir—no lightning-struck tree: you
          are green and vigorous. Plants will grow about your roots, whether you
          ask them or not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow;
          and as they grow they will lean towards you, and wind round you,
          because your strength offers them so safe a prop.” Again he smiled: I
          gave him comfort. “You speak of friends, Jane?” he asked. “Yes, of
          friends,” I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant more than
          friends, but could not tell what other word to employ. He helped me.
          “Ah! Jane. But I want a wife.” “Do you, sir?” “Yes: is it news to
          you?” “Of course: you said nothing about it before.” “Is it unwelcome
          news?” “That depends on circumstances, sir—on your choice.” “Which you
          shall make for me, Jane. I will abide by your decision.” “Choose then,
          sir—_her who loves you best_.” “I will at least choose—_her I love
          best_. Jane, will you marry me?” “Yes, sir.” “A poor blind man, whom
          you will have to lead about by the hand?” “Yes, sir.” “A crippled man,
          twenty years older than you, whom you will have to wait on?” “Yes,
          sir.” “Truly, Jane?” “Most truly, sir.” “Oh! my darling! God bless you
          and reward you!” “Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my
          life—if ever I thought a good thought—if ever I prayed a sincere and
          blameless prayer—if ever I wished a righteous wish,—I am rewarded now.
          To be your wife is, for me, to be as happy as I can be on earth.”
          “Because you delight in sacrifice.” “Sacrifice! What do I sacrifice?
          Famine for food, expectation for content. To be privileged to put my
          arms round what I value—to press my lips to what I love—to repose on
          what I trust: is that to make a sacrifice? If so, then certainly I
          delight in sacrifice.” “And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to
          overlook my deficiencies.” “Which are none, sir, to me. I love you
          better now, when I can really be useful to you, than I did in your
          state of proud independence, when you disdained every part but that of
          the giver and protector.” “Hitherto I have hated to be helped—to be
          led: henceforth, I feel I shall hate it no more. I did not like to put
          my hand into a hireling’s, but it is pleasant to feel it circled by
          Jane’s little fingers. I preferred utter loneliness to the constant
          attendance of servants; but Jane’s soft ministry will be a perpetual
          joy. Jane suits me: do I suit her?” “To the finest fibre of my nature,
          sir.” “The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we
          must be married instantly.” He looked and spoke with eagerness: his
          old impetuosity was rising. “We must become one flesh without any
          delay, Jane: there is but the licence to get—then we marry.” “Mr.
          Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its
          meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner. Let me look
          at your watch.” “Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it
          henceforward: I have no use for it.” “It is nearly four o’clock in the
          afternoon, sir. Don’t you feel hungry?” “The third day from this must
          be our wedding-day, Jane. Never mind fine clothes and jewels, now: all
          that is not worth a fillip.” “The sun has dried up all the rain-drops,
          sir. The breeze is still: it is quite hot.” “Do you know, Jane, I have
          your little pearl necklace at this moment fastened round my bronze
          scrag under my cravat? I have worn it since the day I lost my only
          treasure, as a memento of her.” “We will go home through the wood:
          that will be the shadiest way.” He pursued his own thoughts without
          heeding me. “Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my
          heart swells with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just
          now. He sees not as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man
          judges, but far more wisely. I did wrong: I would have sullied my
          innocent flower—breathed guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched
          it from me. I, in my stiff-necked rebellion, almost cursed the
          dispensation: instead of bending to the decree, I defied it. Divine
          justice pursued its course; disasters came thick on me: I was forced
          to pass through the valley of the shadow of death. _His_ chastisements
          are mighty; and one smote me which has humbled me for ever. You know I
          was proud of my strength: but what is it now, when I must give it over
          to foreign guidance, as a child does its weakness? Of late,
          Jane—only—only of late—I began to see and acknowledge the hand of God
          in my doom. I began to experience remorse, repentance; the wish for
          reconcilement to my Maker. I began sometimes to pray: very brief
          prayers they were, but very sincere. “Some days since: nay, I can
          number them—four; it was last Monday night, a singular mood came over
          me: one in which grief replaced frenzy—sorrow, sullenness. I had long
          had the impression that since I could nowhere find you, you must be
          dead. Late that night—perhaps it might be between eleven and twelve
          o’clock—ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated God, that, if
          it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this life, and
          admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of
          rejoining Jane. “I was in my own room, and sitting by the window,
          which was open: it soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I
          could see no stars and only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the
          presence of a moon. I longed for thee, Janet! Oh, I longed for thee
          both with soul and flesh! I asked of God, at once in anguish and
          humility, if I had not been long enough desolate, afflicted,
          tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and peace once more. That I
          merited all I endured, I acknowledged—that I could scarcely endure
          more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my heart’s wishes broke
          involuntarily from my lips in the words—‘Jane! Jane! Jane!’” “Did you
          speak these words aloud?” “I did, Jane. If any listener had heard me,
          he would have thought me mad: I pronounced them with such frantic
          energy.” “And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?”
          “Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange
          point. You will think me superstitious,—some superstition I have in my
          blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true—true at least it is
          that I heard what I now relate. “As I exclaimed ‘Jane! Jane! Jane!’ a
          voice—I cannot tell whence the voice came, but I know whose voice it
          was—replied, ‘I am coming: wait for me;’ and a moment after, went
          whispering on the wind the words—‘Where are you?’ “I’ll tell you, if I
          can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my mind: yet it is
          difficult to express what I want to express. Ferndean is buried, as
          you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies
          unreverberating. ‘Where are you?’ seemed spoken amongst mountains; for
          I heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words. Cooler and fresher at the
          moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in
          some wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting. In spirit, I believe
          we must have met. You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious
          sleep, Jane: perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine;
          for those were your accents—as certain as I live—they were yours!”
          Reader, it was on Monday night—near midnight—that I too had received
          the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied
          to it. I listened to Mr. Rochester’s narrative, but made no disclosure
          in return. The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to
          be communicated or discussed. If I told anything, my tale would be
          such as must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my
          hearer: and that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom,
          needed not the deeper shade of the supernatural. I kept these things
          then, and pondered them in my heart. “You cannot now wonder,”
          continued my master, “that when you rose upon me so unexpectedly last
          night, I had difficulty in believing you any other than a mere voice
          and vision, something that would melt to silence and annihilation, as
          the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted before. Now, I thank
          God! I know it to be otherwise. Yes, I thank God!” He put me off his
          knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his brow, and bending
          his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute devotion. Only the
          last words of the worship were audible. “I thank my Maker, that, in
          the midst of judgment, he has remembered mercy. I humbly entreat my
          Redeemer to give me strength to lead henceforth a purer life than I
          have done hitherto!” Then he stretched his hand out to be led. I took
          that dear hand, held it a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my
          shoulder: being so much lower of stature than he, I served both for
          his prop and guide. We entered the wood, and wended homeward.
