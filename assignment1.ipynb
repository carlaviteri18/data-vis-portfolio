This format supports direct comparison, effectively highlighting trends and differences without the visual confusion that can arise from stacked charts. By choosing a vivid red-wine color to represent red wine and a beige color for white wine, I enhance the visual clarity and intuitive understanding of the data. This deliberate choice of colors not only mirrors the actual colors of the wines but also makes it easier for anyone looking at the chart to quickly grasp which wine typically reaches higher alcohol levels. My goal is to present these insights in a way that is instantly understandable, helping industry professionals make well-informed decisions with just a glance.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":417},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":220,"status":"ok","timestamp":1715825799725,"user":{"displayName":"Carla VN","userId":"15979292467360622599"},"user_tz":300},"id":"8YxQPbx9her9","outputId":"8925f048-1e02-4134-927e-5450cf331548"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<html>\n","<head>\n","  <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js\"></script>\n","  <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n","    google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['corechart']});\n","    google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);\n","\n","    function drawChart() {\n","      var queryString = encodeURIComponent('SELECT M, K');\n","      var query = new google.visualization.Query(\n","          'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1th-bpYd-1s8cSJkLbhf1yfgwUOFnshEuaazA-WtLbDw/gviz/tq?gid=1237635674&headers=1&tq=' + queryString);\n","      query.send(handleQueryResponse);\n","    }\n","\n","    function handleQueryResponse(response) {\n","      if (response.isError()) {\n","        alert('Error in query: ' + response.getMessage() + ' ' + response.getDetailedMessage());\n","        return;\n","      }\n","\n","      var data = response.getDataTable();\n","      var counts = {\n","        '8-9': {red: 0, white: 0},\n","        '9-10': {red: 0, white: 0},\n","        '10-11': {red: 0, white: 0},\n","        '11-12': {red: 0, white: 0},\n","        '12-13': {red: 0, white: 0},\n","        '13-14': {red: 0, white: 0},\n","        '14-15': {red: 0, white: 0}\n","      };\n","\n","      for (var i = 0;

This approach not only allows us to view the individual trends of each wine color but also their combined effect, offering a visual summary of total alcohol distribution by color. The choice of using different colors within the stacked layers helps differentiate the contributions of each wine type, making it clearer how each influences the overall pattern across the spectrum of alcohol content. This visualization is effective for spotting trends in wine composition and understanding the dynamics between the two wine colors over varying alcohol strengths."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":417},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":20,"status":"ok","timestamp":1715825123917,"user":{"displayName":"Carla VN","userId":"15979292467360622599"},"user_tz":300},"id":"VCG-QMGg6H7_","outputId":"e7bb741a-131a-4a84-9c3d-610006b53706"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<html>\n","<head>\n","  <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js\"></script>\n","  <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n","    google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['corechart']});\n","    google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);\n","\n","    function drawChart() {\n","      var queryString = encodeURIComponent('SELECT M, K');\n","      var query = new google.visualization.Query(\n","          'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1th-bpYd-1s8cSJkLbhf1yfgwUOFnshEuaazA-WtLbDw/gviz/tq?gid=1237635674&headers=1&tq=' + queryString);\n","      query.send(handleQueryResponse);\n","    }\n","\n","    function handleQueryResponse(response) {\n","      if (response.isError()) {\n","        alert('Error in query: ' + response.getMessage() + ' ' + response.getDetailedMessage());\n","        return;\n","      }\n","\n","      var data = response.getDataTable();\n","      var counts = {\n","        '8-9': {red: 0, white: 0},\n","        '9-10': {red: 0, white: 0},\n","        '10-11': {red: 0, white: 0},\n","        '11-12': {red: 0, white: 0},\n","        '12-13': {red: 0, white: 0},\n","        '13-14': {red: 0, white: 0},\n","        '14-15': {red: 0, white: 0}\n","      };\n","\n","      for (var i = 0;
